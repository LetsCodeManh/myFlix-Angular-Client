## Technologies used

- Angular
- Angular Material
- SCSS
- TypeScript

## My role and tasks

As the sole developer of this project, I took on the role of designing and building the application from scratch. I faced the challenge of learning a new framework (Angular) and integrating it with Angular Material, as well as working with a new language (TypeScript).

## Decisions and consequences

One of the key decisions I took was to use Angular Material for the basic UI components, and SCSS for the real styling. This decision was made because I was not yet familiar with Angular Material and wanted to make styling easier. The consequence of this decision was a clean and visually appealing application.

## What would I do differently

If I coud do anything differently, I would try to make the application more responsive and spend more time learning Angular and TypeScript to write cleaner code, especially if this was a real-world application.

## Lessons learned

I learned a lot about Angular and Angular Material, as well as working with TypeScript, during this project. I also gained a better understanding of how to integrate different technologies to build a functional and visually appealing application.

## Angular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.3.

## Installing Angular

Before you can create a new Angular project, you need to have the Angular CLI installed. You can check if you already have it installed by running the following command in your terminal:

```
ng --version
```

If the Angular CLI is not installed, you can install it by running the following command:

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

After installing the Angular CLI, you can check if it was installed successfully by running the following command:

```
ng --version
```

Once you have confirmed that the Angular CLI is installed, you can create a new Angular project by running the following command:

```
ng new your-project-name
```

Replace "your-project-name" with the desired name of your project.

Congratulations, you have just created your first Angular project!

## Cloning the Repository

To clone the repository, follow these steps:

- Open your terminal or command line interface
- Navigate to the directory where you want to store the repository
- Run the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/letscodemanh/myFlix-Angular-Client.git
```

This will download the repository to your local machine.

## Installing Dependecies

Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the project directory using the following command:

```
cd myFlix-Angular-Client
```

To install the dependencies required for the project, run the following command:

```
ng install
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
